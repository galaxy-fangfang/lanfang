I am a 3rd-year Phd candidate at Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris. I work in the [DIG](https://dig.telecom-paris.fr/blog/) team, supervised by Prof. [Mauro Sozio](https://sites.google.com/site/maurosozio/home).

My research topic is about eXplainable AI on anomaly detection and time series prediction.

 I received my undergraduate (2012-2016) and master (2016-2019) degree from [school of Artificial Intelligence and Automation](http://aia.hust.edu.cn/), Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I also worked as a computer vision engineer in [Horizon Robotics](https://en.horizon.cc/) from 2019-2021.
